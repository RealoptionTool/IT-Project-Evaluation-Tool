# ITprojectevaluationtool
Here you can find the link for the [IT project evaluation tool](https://personal-2u8rb8tg.outsystemscloud.com/ITInvestmentprojectEvaluation/Login).
You can use the public account "Andrea McKenzie" or sign up and use your own account. 
The tool allows you to estimate the value of strategic growth options for IT projects. After you provided the system with some characteristics (e.g., interest rate used for calculation, runtime of the project, cashflows) you can calculate the expected option value based on 100,000 simulations. 

The tool is based on the assumptions for strategic growth options from the paper. Thereby, all in- and outflows can follow GMB or GMR and it is also accounted for unforseeable events that can impact the value of the IT investment project (referred to as jumps in the paper).
